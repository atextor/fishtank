fishtank Version 1 - OpenGL fish swarm simulation

Introduction
==============================================================================
Fishtank is a graphical simulation of a fish swarm in a fish tank, and
"sharks" that eat fish. There are several interactive controls:
 * Switch between the different cameras
 * Change the brightness of a glowing fish
 * Add and remove fish and sharks
 * Switch the ceiling lamp and the names of the fish on and off
 * Automatically calculate the number of fish where the frames per
   second drop below 10
 * Export 20 TGA-files per second (quasi video export)
The project was created during the summer semester 2007 in computer graphics
using C++, OpenGL and GLUT.

Code
==============================================================================
If you wonder whats the deal with the strange #defines (like
#define rotation new Rotation) - these defines make it possible to model
a scene graph like VRML right in the C++-code without C++-syntax clutter.
See Main.cpp for a sample (where the Table is modeled).
